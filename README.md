# ShadowAuth

ShadowAuth is a packet authentication framework for a CAN bus.

You can freely use this repo to:

1. [figure out a CAN packet transmission function from ECU firmware](https://github.com/purseclab/ShadowAuth/tree/main/ecu_firmware_analysis),
2. [enhance ECU firmware by detour-based rewriting](https://github.com/purseclab/ShadowAuth/tree/main/ecu_firmware_rewriter), and
3. [build an application for CAN packet authentication](https://github.com/purseclab/ShadowAuth/tree/main/authenticator)

Please see each README for further information.
